==========

flink Kernel Modules for Linux offer drivers capabilities to communicate with various hardware interfaces. Among them are PCI and SPI. 
This documentation is intended for developers to understand the internals of the core driver. This facilitates the creation of new modules for other hardware interfaces. The user documentation can be found in [flink](http://wiki.ntb.ch/infoportal/software/flink).
